WebSockets provide a powerful way to establish a full-duplex communication channel between the client and server, allowing real-time data exchange. This is particularly useful in applications that require live updates, such as chat apps, online gaming, financial dashboards, and collaborative tools. In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore how to effectively implement WebSockets in Flutter, using a robust and well-structured approach.

## **Why WebSockets?**

Imagine youâ€™re building a chat app. You want messages to appear instantly without the user having to refresh the page or wait for updates. WebSockets make this happen by keeping a continuous connection open between your app and the server. This allows data to flow back and forth instantly, giving your users that smooth, real-time experience.

## **Setting Up WebSockets in Flutter**

To get started with WebSockets in Flutter, you first need to import the necessary Dart packages in pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
dependencies:
  retry: ^3.1.0
```

### **Meet the WebSocket Manager**

A well-structured approach to handling WebSocket connections in Flutter is to use a singleton class. This class will handle everything related to WebSockets, from connecting to the server to managing incoming data.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:developer';
import 'dart:io';

class WebSocketManager {
  // Singleton pattern - only one instance of WebSocketManager will exist
  static final WebSocketManager _singleton = WebSocketManager._internal();
  
  // StreamController to manage the flow of data
  final StreamController<Object> streamController = StreamController.broadcast(sync: true);
  
  // Variable to store the WebSocket URL
  late String wsUrl;
  WebSocket? socket;
  WebSocketStatus status = WebSocketStatus.closed;

  // Factory constructor to return the singleton instance
  factory WebSocketManager(String url) {
    _singleton.wsUrl = url;
    return _singleton;
  }

  // Private constructor for the singleton pattern
  WebSocketManager._internal();

  // Initialize the WebSocket connection
  Future<void> initWebSocketConnection() async {
    // Check if the WebSocket is closed before connecting
    if (status == WebSocketStatus.closed) {
      status = WebSocketStatus.connecting;
      log("Socket Connecting...");
      socket = await connectWs();

      // If the connection is successful, open the WebSocket and start listening for data
      if (socket?.readyState == WebSocket.open) {
        socket!.pingInterval = const Duration(seconds: 5);
        status = WebSocketStatus.open;
        log("Connection OPEN");
        broadcast();
      } else {
        // If the connection fails, log the error and close the WebSocket
        log("Connection DONE inside initWebSocketConnection()");
        log("Close Code: ${socket?.closeCode}");
        status = WebSocketStatus.closed;
        streamController.addError('Connection Done with close code: ${socket?.closeCode}');
      }
    }
  }

  // Broadcast data received from the WebSocket to all listeners
  void broadcast() {
    socket?.listen(
      (dynamic streamData) {
        try {
          streamController.add(streamData as String);
        } catch (e) {
          streamController.addError(e.toString());
        }
      },
      onDone: () {
        status = WebSocketStatus.closed;
        log("Connection DONE");
        streamController.addError('Connection Done with close code: ${socket?.closeCode}');
      },
      onError: (dynamic e) async {
        status = WebSocketStatus.closed;
        streamController.addError(e.toString());
      },
    );
  }

  // Connect to the WebSocket server with retry logic
  Future<WebSocket?> connectWs() async {
    // Retry connection with exponential backoff
    const r = RetryOptions(maxAttempts: 20, delayFactor: Duration(seconds: 1));
    WebSocket? response;

    try {
      // Attempt to connect to the WebSocket server
      response = await r.retry(
        () => WebSocket.connect(wsUrl),
        retryIf: (e) {
          // You can provide any condition for retrying
          return true;
        },
        onRetry: (e) {
          log("Socket Connection Error: $e");
          log("Retrying!");
        },
      );
    } on TimeoutException {
      // If the connection times out, try again
      log("Socket TimeoutException!");
      initWebSocketConnection();
      return null;
    } catch (e) {
      // If there's another type of error, log it or handle it accordingly
      log("Socket connection error: $e");
      return null;
    }

    return response;
  }

  // Function for dispose of the WebSocket connection
  Future<void> dispose() async {
    await socket?.close();
    socket = null;
    status = WebSocketStatus.closed;
  }
}
```

**Key Components of the WebSocketManager Class**

* **Singleton Pattern**: The class uses a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of WebSocketManager exists, managing the WebSocket connection across the entire app.
    
* **StreamController**: This is used to broadcast incoming messages from the WebSocket to multiple listeners within the app.
    
* **WebSocket Status**: The WebSocketStatus enum tracks the state of the WebSocket connection (open, closed, or connecting).
    
* **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter is implemented using the retry package, allowing the WebSocket to automatically retry the connection multiple times if it fails.
    

### **Adding WebSocketManager to Your Flutter App**

Once youâ€™ve set up the WebSocketManager class, the next step is to integrate it into your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to use the WebSocketManager in your app:

```dart
// Initialize the WebSocketManager with the appropriate WebSocket URL
wsManager = WebSocketManager("https://echo.websocket.org/");

// Establish the WebSocket connection
wsManager?.initWebSocketConnection();

// Retrieve the StreamController from the WebSocketManager
final streamController = wsManager?.streamController;

// ...

// Listen to the WebSocket stream and handle incoming data
StreamBuilder<dynamic>(
  stream: streamController?.stream, // The stream of data from the WebSocket
  builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<dynamic> snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.hasError) {
      // Show an error message in the UI
      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
    }

    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      // Show a loading indicator while waiting for the stream to emit data
      return const CircularProgressIndicator();
    }

    if (snapshot.hasData) {
      // Display the received data in the UI
      return Text('Received data: ${snapshot.data}'); 
    }

    // Show a default message if no data is received
    return const Text('No data available');
  },
)
```

**Whatâ€™s Going On Here?**

* **WebSocket Initialization**: We start by creating our WebSocketManager with a URL. This URL tells the WebSocket where to connect.
    
* **Connection Setup**: Next, we call `initWebSocketConnection()` to start the connection. This gets our WebSocket up and running.
    
* **StreamController**: Remember that radio broadcaster? Weâ€™re tuning into it here. We grab the StreamController from our WebSocketManager to listen to any messages coming through.
    
* **StreamBuilder**: This function builds the UI every time a new snapshot of data arrives on the stream. It also runs when the streamâ€™s connection state changes.
    

This approach ensures that your UI stays responsive and up-to-date with real-time data from the WebSocket.

## **Conclusion**

WebSockets in Flutter might sound a bit intimidating at first, but with a solid understanding of how to manage connections and data, youâ€™ll be up and running in no time. Remember, the key is to keep it simple, handle errors gracefully, and enjoy the process of bringing real-time communication to life in your app!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
